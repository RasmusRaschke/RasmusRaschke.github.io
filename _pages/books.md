## A collection of books, primarily as reference for my projects and notes.

### Algebra
 - Sheldon Axler: [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://linear.axler.net/), 4th edition: I use this book as my main linear algebra reference. Fortunately, it is freely avaliable.
 - Paolo Aluffi: Algebra: Chapter 0, 1st edition: This is my main reference for abstract algebra and some cathegory theory.

### Analysis
 - Otto Forster: Analysis 1, 2, 3: These are my analysis reference books, covering real analysis in one and several variables, introductory ODEs and integration theory.
 - Paul Rudin: Principles of Mathematical Analysis: I worked with this book sometimes, especially to brush up on some topics in real analysis.
